# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in this project, we encourage you to responsibly disclose it to us. We take security seriously and appreciate your effort in helping to keep the project secure.

### How to report a security issue:
1. **Email us directly** at [ravi.kumar250201@gmail.com](mailto:ravi.kumar250201@gmail.com).
2. Provide a clear description of the vulnerability, including any relevant information such as:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Affected versions of the project
   - Any potential impact or exploitation details

### We will work to:
- Verify the issue
- Respond to you as quickly as possible (typically within a week)
- Provide a timeline for any potential fixes or mitigation

## Supported Versions

We strive to fix critical security vulnerabilities in a timely manner and encourage users to stay up to date with the latest version.

| Version        | Supported |
| -------------- | --------- |
| Latest release | ✅        |
| Older versions | ❌        |

**Note**: We recommend upgrading to the latest supported version to minimize security risks.

## Security Updates

We will issue security patches and updates for supported versions as needed. When a security update is available, a release will be tagged with "security" and made available through the official release channels.

## Best Practices

- **Keep your dependencies updated**: Ensure that your dependencies and libraries are up-to-date.
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the bot and users.
- **Restrict Bot Permissions**: Only assign necessary permissions to the bot.
- **Secure Environment Variables**: Store sensitive tokens like API keys in environment variables, not in the codebase.

## Contribution Guidelines

If you're contributing to this project, please ensure:
- Your code is free of security vulnerabilities.
- You follow best security practices when implementing new features.
- You avoid introducing any potential attack vectors such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
